# OIBSIP-Project1-Iris-Flower-Classification
 The Iris Flower Classification is a classic dataset and problem in the field of machine learning and data science. In this module, students will explore the fundamentals of classification algorithms using the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.This description covers the key aspects of the Iris Flower Classification module in a Data Science course, providing students with a comprehensive learning experience from data exploration to model evaluation.
